# MIPS-Simulation
MIPS single cycled datapath simulation in JAVA

1. The Processor has 32 registers.
2. Register Zero (R0) is always 0.
3. Each unit in the datapath should be simulated.
4. Control signals should be the condition of all the steps in the
implementation.
5. Prints the following after each instruction:
  ❖ Registers content.
  ❖ Memory content (effective addresses content in case of
  memory instruction).
  ❖ Control Signals for this particular instruction.
